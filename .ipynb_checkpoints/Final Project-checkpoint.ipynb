    "## 1. Introduction to the Problem\n",
    "### Imagine...\n",
    "You're a bright, ambitious high school senior preparing to enter college. For years you've had a fascination with computers and the exciting research surrounding them. In short, you want to study and contribute to the field of computer science. But where should you study? Which Universities have research you're interested in? Does research influence the computer science education? What should you do?\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "There are numerous resources to determine top computer science programs, one of the most famous being U.S. News and World Report's. What factors does U.S. News and World Report use when determining rankings? How is research factored into that? And that is what we aim to find out.<br><br>\n",
    "**How does research quantity and topic influence the rankings of computer science school?**<br><br>\n",
    "This problem is important for several reasons. One, choosing a university is an extremely important decision, one which requires as much information as possible. Two, one gets out of university what they put in. In other words, if a student seeks an academic track, they would prefer a university with an emphasis on research and publication. If they seek a professional track, these metrics matter less. And three, knowing a schools area of research (and how prevalent their research is in the field) is important when making a decision. A systems research oriented student would not be university searching with the same criteria as a data science oriented student looking to work in industry.\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "To answer these questions and help students make more informed university decisions, we will be analyzing data from csrankings.com in terms of their rankings as well as their data on computer science research from the past ten years. There have been previous analyses on faculty number and rankings (https://krixly.github.io/) however this projects seeks to find correlations between research quantity and area on rankings.\n",
    "#### Ulterior Motives?\n",
    "This analysis also doubles as a tutorial in data science, particularly the data science pipeline. Data science seeks to analyze data to extract meaning. In our case, this meaning comes in the form of understanding how research affects CS rankings. The pipeline we use includes: Data collection and organization, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing and machine learning, and finally interpretation and meaning explanation. To aid in this understanding, we have included extra resources in the form of links and definitions.<br>For more information on data science in general, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science<br>For more information on the data science pipeline, visit: https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-guide-to-the-data-science-pipeline-a4904b2d8ad3"

    "## 2. Data Collection and Organization\n",
    "#### General Data Collection and Organization Info\n",
    "The first step in the data science pipeline is data collection and organization. There are many ways to collect data that range from running your own scientific experiments, polling a sample, to scraping data from a web servie. Data scraping means using code to extract data from another program. A common practice in python data science is to read the data into a dataframe, which is a table structure which makes data manipulation and analysis easy. Once the data is in a dataframe certain issues arise such as missing or duplicated data. To combat this, we cleanse the data to ensure it has only valid values and won't be skewed by duplications. Finally, the last step of this section is data organization which is when you drop unwanted data and tidy the data. Tidy data is when each row represents a single observation (in our case, each row will be a university).<br>More info on tidy data(pdf download): https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10/v59i10.pdf\n",
    "#### Our Data Collection and Organization\n",
    "We scraped data from csrankings.org (see link below). This data contains the raw data used to create this sources Top 20 CS schools rankings. It includes information on professors, their publications, their associated universities, and the area of research. An important aspect of data scraping is its human readability. A csv file (Def: CSV- comma separated values) organizes rows of a data table by separating each data entry with a comma. We read our data into a dataframe.\n",
    "<br>Follow the steps below to see how we scraped, cleansed, and tidied our data.\n",

We do this by combining all the data into a new dataframe where each row corresponds to a university. We will also begin doing data collection on our data.

    "IMPORTANT FOR KALYAN!!! The two untracked reseach areas are Human-Computer interaction (chiconf) and I couldn't figure out what 'pets' was. But defnitely write about the untracked research areas. I determined these because on the csrankings.org website they list 73 research areas used to calculate the list. Those two areas are in the dataset but don't factor in for some reason<br><br>Another important thing to write about is how this ranking is totally quantitative, while US NEws and world report uses polling data from department heads (who are definitely biased towards their own universities)<br><br>\n",
    "(fill this in with conclusion stuff. I just wanted to write the very end so it ties back to the beginning 'Imagine' section)\n",
    "<br><br>So...<br>Now you're well versed in both how research influences university rankings and the data science pipeline. With this tutorial you could perform your own analyses on how publication affects other ranking systems (U.S. News and World Report?) or any data driven question. Curious about how poverty in America vs the rest of the world? The effect of temperature on NFL football games? Use these tools to master data and extract meaning from the world around you!<br><br>For a more comprehensive look at data science and machine learning, there are many online classes.
