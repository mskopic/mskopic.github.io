320 Final Project Organization:
structure: theres a list of things that need to get done and who will do them. MS is mitchell, KK is kalyan
To do:
-finish data scraping and cleaning
	-clean data for missing areas of study MS DONE
	-clean data for missing university MS DONE
	-remove data on universtities not in top 20 MS DONE
	-remove any research from earlier than 2008 MS DONE
	-find if there is any unicorporated data and make new dataframe MS DONE
	-write about all of these MS
-EDA (can be done before data cleaning is done) MS
	-count number of submissions for each type of submissions
	-count number of publications from each unniversity
	-count number of pubs from each uni and area, including untracked data
	-combine these into a table
	-plot data (we could make a lot of plots of just this)
	-**need 4 plots here so probably need to do other types of analysis (year spikes?)
		-a cool one would be to rank schools based on the amount of publications they do in each category
		-BUT this^ might be better to save for the end if we do find a correlation between publication amount and
	-write about each of the above steps
-Analysis
	-establish null hypothesis on publication number
	-test null hypothesis with ML functions
	-write about it
	-repeat for whether certain publication areas lead to higher ranks than others
		-or maybe if diversity of publication matters more?
		-**repeat for the dataframe including untracked areas of research. How does the untracked data influence the analysis?
-Conclusion
	-extract the meaning from the analysis
	-comment on the effect of publication number and type on ranking
		-show charts
	-conclude on the pipeline
	-include more resources
	-suggest future studies which could be done
